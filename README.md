Student Performance Prediction using MLP
📌 Project Overview
This project is a Machine Learning web application that predicts a student’s academic performance based on demographic and educational factors.
It uses a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model and is deployed using Flask.
The application allows users (teachers, institutions, or analysts) to input student details through a web interface and instantly receive predicted performance scores.


🎯 Problem Statement
Educational institutions need a way to analyze and predict student performance in advance so that timely academic interventions can be planned.
This project predicts student performance using features such as:

Gender
Race/Ethnicity
Parental education level
Lunch type
Test preparation course
Reading and writing scores
